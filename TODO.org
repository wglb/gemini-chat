The defensive coding we added to extract-txt ensures that your program doesn't crash when it
receives an incomplete response. Instead of halting, the function now gracefully returns nil. This
gives you the perfect opportunity to implement a simple retry mechanism in the code that calls
extract-txt.

A good strategy would be to:

Call the gemini-conversation function (or whichever function makes the API call).

If extract-txt returns nil, log the event.

Wait for a short period of time (e.g., 2-5 seconds) to avoid overwhelming the server.

Retry the same query.

You could wrap this logic in a loop that tries a few times before giving up and reporting a more
critical error to the user. This makes your program much more resilient to temporary API quirks or
unexpected responses.
