(defun get-tool-definitions ()
;;  return something like this

1. Define the Tool Specification
First, you need to create a JSON-formatted description of the functions the model can call. This defines the function's purpose, its parameters, and their types. In Common Lisp, you would create a function that returns this structure using a library like jsown.

You would add a function like (defun get-tool-definitions ()) to return a list of tool objects
  
  (jsown:to-json
   (jsown:new-js
    ("tools" (jsown:new-js
              ("function_declarations" (list
                                        (jsown:new-js
                                         ("name" "get_current_weather")
                                         ("description" "Get the current weather in a given location.")
                                         ("parameters"
                                          (jsown:new-js
                                           ("type" "OBJECT")
                                           ("properties" (jsown:new-js
                                                          ("location" (jsown:new-js
                                                                       ("type" "STRING")
                                                                       ("description" "The city and state, e.g. Boston, MA")))
                                                          ("unit" (jsown:new-js
                                                                   ("type" "STRING")
                                                                   ("enum" (list "celsius" "fahrenheit"))
                                                                   ("description" "The unit of temperature")))
                                                          ))
                                           ("required" (list "location"))
                                           ))
                                         ))
									   ))

			 ))))


;;; change make-gemini-api-request to have

;; Pseudo-code for response handling in gem-conv
(let ((response (make-gemini-api-request...)))
  (let ((tool-calls (jsown:val (jsown:val response "parts") "tool_calls")))
    (if tool-calls
        (handle-tool-call tool-calls)
        (display-text-response response))))

(jsown:to-json
 (jsown:new-js
  ("contents" (list ...))
  ("tools" (get-tool-definitions)) ;; <--- Add this line
  ...))



3. Handle the Function Call Response
When the Gemini model wants to call a function, it will not return a regular text response. Instead, the response object you get back will contain a tool_calls part. Your gemini-chat program will need to be updated to check for this.

Your code would need to inspect the response to see if it contains a tool_calls object. If so, it must parse the JSON to get the function's name and its arguments.


;; Pseudo-code for response handling in gem-conv
(let ((response (make-gemini-api-request...)))
  (let ((tool-calls (jsown:val (jsown:val response "parts") "tool_calls")))
    (if tool-calls
        (handle-tool-call tool-calls)
        (display-text-response response))))


4. Execute the Lisp Function

You will need a dispatcher function that maps the string name from the model's tool_calls object (e.g., "get_current_weather") to an actual Common Lisp function (e.g., get-current-weather).
This can be done with a case or cond statement. 

(defun handle-tool-call (tool-calls)
  (let* ((tool-call (first tool-calls))
         (name (jsown:val tool-call "name"))
         (args (jsown:val tool-call "args")))
    (case (intern (string-upcase name) :keyword)
      (:get-current-weather (get-current-weather
                             (jsown:val args "location")
                             (jsown:val args "unit"))))))


5. Send the Function's Result Back to the Model

Finally, you must take the output from your executed Lisp function and send it back to the Gemini API. The response you send back will be a new ToolResponse part, and the model will use it to generate a final, human-readable answer.

This would involve making a new API call with a modified conversation history that includes both the model's function call and the result of your executed function. The history array in the request body would be appended with a new entry for the function response.

;; Pseudo-code for sending tool response
(let* ((tool-call-response (jsown:new-js
                             ("toolResponse"
                               (jsown:new-js
                                 ("name" "get_current_weather")
                                 ("content" result-from-lisp-function)))))
       (new-history (append old-history (list tool-call-response))))
  (make-gemini-api-request :history new-history))


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, that is exactly right. In the context of Function Calling with the Gemini API, "tools" are functions or commands that you, the developer, have implemented and made available on your local machine or server.

The process is a collaboration between the Gemini model and your application:

You Define the Tools: You write code (in this case, Common Lisp) that performs specific actions, such as getting weather data, searching a database, or even interacting with your operating system. You then create a JSON-formatted description of these functions.

The Model Suggests a Tool: When the model receives a user's prompt (e.g., "What's the weather like in Boston?"), it doesn't try to answer the question itself. Instead, it recognizes that it needs to call one of the tools you defined. It returns a response that specifies the function name (get_current_weather) and the required arguments (location: "Boston, MA").

Your Code Executes the Tool: Your gemini-chat program receives this function-call response, identifies the correct Lisp function, and executes it.

You Provide the Result to the Model: Your program takes the result of the function execution (e.g., "The weather in Boston is 72 degrees Fahrenheit") and sends it back to the Gemini API in a new prompt as a ToolResponse.

The Model Synthesizes the Final Answer: The model now uses the information you provided to generate a natural, human-readable response to the user's original question (e.g., "The current weather in Boston, MA is 72 degrees Fahrenheit.").

So, the "tools" are not pre-built within the API; they are your local functions that the model can be instructed to "call."
